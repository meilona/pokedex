# pokedex_web

Pokédex Web is a lightweight Flutter app to browse Pokémon quickly. It shows a responsive grid of Pokémon with pagination, and a simple detail view for each Pokémon—name, types, base stats, evolution chain, and moves—powered by the public PokéAPI. Clean UI, fast, and built with GetX for state management.
